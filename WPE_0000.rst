==================
First Set of Tasks
==================

This document highlights the first set of tasks that need to be done before we go public.


1) Identification of data sources
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* The first task is to identify possible sources for data acquisition.

* `NOAA <https://www.noaa.gov/topic-tags/wildfires>`_ and `NASA <https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/toolkits/wildfires>`_
  are obvious resources that we will support.

* `USGS <https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/apis>`_ is another potentially useful resource.

2) Making Clients for the data sources
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Once we have recognised the server APIs, we need client APIs that will search and fetch the data.

* `Parfive <https://github.com/Cadair/parfive>`_ will be the downloader that we will use.

* The idea here is to get a unified API where we can get different types of data from various sources using a single interface.
