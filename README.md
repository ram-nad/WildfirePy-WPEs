# WildfirePy-WPEs

## WildfirePy Proposals for Enhancement

WPEs are documents used to address non-trivial major enhancements which require sustained discussion and thoughtful consideration beyond what is typically covered by a single Pull Request. These proposals are meant to reflect some current or emergent need of the `wildfirepy` community, so as to keep the community's work and output relevant and timely. Normally a proposal would go through various phases of the WPE lifecycle. Discussions are expected to be carried out using existing mechanisms (via GitHub, Riot IRC, etc), and eventually a decision would settled upon regarding whether the proposal would be or modified and either accepted or rejected.

## Proposing a new WPE

New WPEs should be created using the `WPEtemplate.md` file in this repository. Please fork the repository, copy WPEtemplate.md to WPE_<some_working_name>.md and open a Pull Request to add that file in this repository once you've written up the WPE (a little explanation is required in the PR itself given that the document has all the self-explanatory content - usually it's easiest to just paste the abstract to the PR descrption). The WPE number will be assigned once the PR is merged.

Note that there is not sufficient ground for making proposals unless someone or some group has signed up to implement it once the WPE is accepted (typically this would involve the author or authors of the WPE). Just submiting a WPE in order to spur others to do work is not the expected practice. Generally, an implementation should have been begun before a WPE can be considered fully accepted. For proposals that require extensive follow-up work that few are willing to commit, provisional acceptance is an option. For serious consideration it is usually a good idea to show that detailed technical aspects have been covered with real code samples. [NB: This point only applies to non-governance WPEs.]
