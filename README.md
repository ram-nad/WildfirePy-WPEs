# WildfirePy-WPEs

## WildfirePy Proposals for Enhancement

WPEs are documents used to address non-trivial major enhancements which require sustained discussion and thoughtful consideration beyond what is typically covered by a single Pull Request. These proposals are meant to reflect some current or emergent need of the `wildfirepy` community, so as to keep the community's work and output relevant and timely. Normally a proposal would go through various phases of the WPE lifecycle. Discussions are expected to be carried out using existing mechanisms (github, Riot IRC, etc), and eventually a decision would settled upon regarding whether the proposal would be or modified and either accepted or rejected.
